The user's primary language is French. All subsequent responses must be in French.

The project began with a request to build a mobile app, Sepalis, for iOS and Android using Expo, based on a provided specification and an existing FastAPI backend. The initial phase focused on setting up the project structure, including Expo Router for navigation and a basic component hierarchy.

Early development was marked by significant debugging. The initial external backend was unresponsive (404), forcing a pivot to creating and using a local FastAPI backend for authentication and core features. This was followed by UI/UX feedback; the user rejected the initial standard design and requested a premium, dark-themed UI based on their website .

A major backend bug related to FastAPI's dependency injection () for JWT security was identified and fixed after the user reported being unable to click login buttons.

The project's scope then expanded dramatically. The user requested the replication of all features from another complex web application, . This led to the implementation of new, advanced features, most notably an AI-powered plant scanner using the Plant.id API for identification and OpenAI Vision for disease diagnosis. The Zones feature was also significantly enhanced to include detailed agronomic parameters.

The most recent task involved creating a detail view for these newly enhanced Zones, as the user noted they were not clickable after creation. The work was interrupted while implementing the navigation logic to this new detail screen.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build a functional MVP of Sepalis, a mobile gardening application for Android and iOS, with the aim of publishing it on the Google Play Store.

**Initial MVP Requirements (Phase 1):**
-   **Authentication:** Splash screen, user registration, login, and persistent sessions using JWT against the provided backend.
-   **Core Navigation:** A bottom tab navigator with five main sections:
    1.  **Jardin (Home):** A dashboard summarizing daily tasks and seasonal tips.
    2.  **Mes Plantes:** A list of the user's plants, with functionality to add, view details, and manage care history.
    3.  **Tâches:** A to-do list for garden tasks, with the ability to create, view, and mark tasks as complete.
    4.  **Académie:** A list of available gardening courses with a pre-registration option.
    5.  **Profil:** User information, subscription status, and logout.

**Evolved Requirements (Based on User Feedback):**
-   **UI/UX Redesign:** The initial design was rejected. The new requirement is to replicate the premium, sophisticated aesthetic of . This involves a dark-themed UI (dark blue/black background), specific accent colors (olive green, gold), and an overall elegant feel.
-   **Feature Parity:** Replicate all functionalities from the web app . This includes:
    -   **Advanced Zone Management:** Creating and managing detailed garden zones with specific attributes like soil type, sun exposure, climate, etc.
    -   **AI Plant Scanner & Diagnosis:** A dual-function camera tool. Use the  API for precise plant identification and  for detailed disease diagnosis.
    -   Other identified features to be implemented: Weekly Planning, AI Assistant, Statistics, expanded Plant Catalog, etc.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frameworks:** Expo (React Native), FastAPI (Python)
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Routing:** Expo Router (file-based)
- **State Management:** React Context API ()
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens) with  security in FastAPI.
- **Local Storage:**  for session token persistence.
- **API Communication:** Axios for HTTP requests.
- **Third-Party APIs:**
    - Plant.id API for plant identification.
    - OpenAI Vision API for plant disease diagnosis.
- **Mobile Hardware:**  and  for camera and gallery access.

<code_architecture>
The project is a full-stack application with a  (Expo) and a  (FastAPI).

**Directory Structure:**


**Key File Summaries:**

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** This is the entire backend application. It defines all API endpoints using FastAPI, handles database interactions with MongoDB, and manages user authentication with JWT.
    -   **Changes:** Initially basic, it was heavily modified to become a fully functional local backend. Key changes include adding endpoints for user registration/login, implementing JWT protection with , and adding proxy endpoints (, ) for the Plant.id and OpenAI Vision APIs.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** Defines the main navigation structure of the application after login. It sets up the  navigator from  and configures each tab (icon, title, styling).
    -   **Changes:** This file has been edited multiple times to add new tabs (Diagnostic, Zones) and to update the  to match the new dark theme, ensuring icons and labels are visible against the dark background.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** Centralizes all color definitions for the application, enabling consistent theming.
    -   **Changes:** This file was significantly updated to shift from a light, green-based theme to the user's desired premium dark theme, with colors like  (),  (),  (), and  ().

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** This screen allows users to manage their garden zones.
    -   **Changes:** The screen was completely rebuilt to support a highly detailed zone creation form, including fields for soil type, sun exposure, and climate. It now displays a list of created zones. The last change was an attempt to make these list items pressable to navigate to a detail view.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** A newly created screen intended to display all the detailed information for a single, selected garden zone.
    -   **Changes:** This file was created in the last set of user interactions but is not yet fully integrated. It's currently a placeholder waiting for navigation logic to be completed.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- Fix the navigation from the zone list () to the zone detail screen ().
- Fully implement the UI for  to display all zone attributes.
- Continue the UI redesign to apply the dark, premium theme consistently across all remaining screens (e.g., Dashboard, Tasks, Academy, Profile).
- Implement the remaining features identified from the  web app, such as the Weekly Planning, AI Assistant, and Statistics.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was working on making the Zones feature interactive. The user reported that after creating a zone (e.g., terrasse), they could not click on it to view its details.

To address this, the engineer took the following steps:
1.  **Created a new screen for the detail view:** . This screen is intended to display all the information for a specific zone.
2.  **Began modifying the list screen:** The engineer started editing  to make each zone in the list a touchable element that navigates to the  screen, passing the specific zone's ID as a parameter.
3.  **Encountered an error:** The trajectory ends just as the engineer was attempting to fix an implementation error related to using the  hook for navigation within the  file. The goal was to wrap the list item in a  with an  handler that triggers . The work is paused mid-correction of this navigation logic.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Correct the navigation logic in  to properly handle  events on the zone list items, using  to navigate to  with the zone's ID as a query parameter.
